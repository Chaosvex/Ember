## *An experimental modular MMO server emulator.*

---

Ember is an educational and research emulator developed to investigate MMO server architectures and bleeding-edge C++ language features and tooling.

While most emulators strive for feature completeness, Ember aims to be a production quality codebase and deployment architecture.

### Docker Quick Start

Ember uses Docker to make it easy to get the project up and running within minutes. Once you have Docker (version 19 and up) installed, simply run...

Linux & MacOS:

```bash
DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1 docker build <path to Dockerfile>
```

Windows:

```cmd
set "DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1" && docker build <path to Dockerfile>
```

Ember uses `DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1` to enable experimental features that allow for build caching. It can be omitted by setting it as an environmental variable.

Want to do it the traditional way? That's fine too, just see docs/GettingStarted.md.

### Supported platforms

Ember aims to support the following platforms as a minimum:

| Operating System  | Architectures |
| :------------ |:---------------:|
| Linux         | x86, x64, ARMv7 |
| Windows       | x86, x64        |
| Mac OS        | x86, x64        |

### Compiler support

This table lists the compilers actively used during development as well as the oldest versions that should support the language features needed to compile the codebase. The minimum versions are not frequently tested, therefore they are not guaranteed to be compatible.

|       |  Supported  |   Minimum   |
|-------|:-----------:|:-----------:|
| MSVC  | 19.21 (VS2019) | 19.7 (VS2017) |
| Clang |     8.0     |     5.0     |
| GCC   |     8.1     |     8.1     |

### Why WoW 1.12.1?

Our primary goal isn't to produce a feature-complete, up-to-date emulator to use with newer clients. The 1.12.1 protocol was chosen as a fixed target to leverage the extensive research of prior projects, allowing for greater focus on writing code over reverse engineering.
